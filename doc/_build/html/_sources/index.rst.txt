Welcome to pysubgroup's documentation!
======================================

**pysubgroup** is a Python package that enables subgroup discovery in
Python+pandas (scipy stack) data analysis environment.
It provides for a lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible and freely available
implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms, interestingness measures and presentation options.

As of 2018, this library is still in a prototype phase.
It has, however, been already successfully employed in active application projects.
